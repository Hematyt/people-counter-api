### people-counter-api
Basic solution for counting people on picture

there are 3 endpoints. 2 are available from home page:
* add default picture in format: .jpg, .jpeg, .png
* use picture ('droga.jpg') from folder 'images'

To use last endpoint (with url) write:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/2/?img_url=adres_zdjecia
but change 'adres_zdjecia' to your url
